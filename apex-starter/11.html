            <p>When an event takes place in Salesforce, it follows an <em>Order of Execution</em>(Described later in this chapter) that calls Triggers at multiple points and is one of the many ways to invoke Apex Code. If we see triggers in a coffee
              making process, it is doing a set of actions when specific events take place. For example, when we put water in the pot to boil, we usually wait for steam to come out before we pour it out, as if something in the brain goes <em>if steam
                is coming out, pour water</em>.</p>
            <p> To write a trigger, we select File &gt; New &gt; Apex Trigger (instead of Apex Class) in Developer console. The syntax for writing a Trigger is:</p>
            <pre><code>trigger TriggerName on Object(triggerEvents){
    //code
}
</code></pre>
            <ul>
              <li><code>trigger</code> keyword for initializing a Trigger.</li>
              <li><code>TriggerName</code> is the name assigned to this Trigger.</li>
              <li><code>on</code> keyword that defines what object are we running it on.</li>
              <li><code>Object</code> is the name of the object on which the trigger will run.</li>
              <li><code>triggerEvents</code> defines <em>when</em> and on <em>what event</em> will the trigger run using the keywords <code>before</code> or <code>after</code> followed by
                standard DML operations like <code>insert</code>. Multiple trigger events are separated using a <code>,</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are two key Trigger class methods to know:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Trigger.new</code> contains all the values that are new in the object.</li>
              <li><code>Trigger.old</code> contains all the values that were in the object before being updated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A real-life example is you take a cup. First you fill it with water, then you pour the water out and add milk in it. <code>Trigger.new</code> will return the value
              <code>milk</code>, and <code>Trigger.old</code> will return the value <code>water</code> when run on the cup. Let’s write a simple trigger on Contact object that checks if the First Name is empty, and fills it as ‘John’ if it is empty.
            </p>
            <pre><code>trigger FirstNamer on Contact(before insert){
    List&lt;Contact&gt; con = Trigger.new;

    for (Contact iterator: con){

        if(iterator.FirstName == null){
            iterator.FirstName = 'John';
        }
    }

}
</code></pre>
            <p>Now let’s head over to our org and make 2 new entries in the Contact object. The first entry should have First and Last Names and the second should have only a Last Name.
              You will notice the second record where no First name was specified, the value <code>John</code> has now been filled instead. Let’s write a trigger that makes use of <code>Trigger.old</code>.</p>
            <p>This new trigger runs on the Contact object and if the old First Name of a Contact was <code>John</code>, we want to replace whatever new value the user has put in with
              <code>Smith</code> instead. So if a person with the name <code>John Cool</code> existed in the database and a user tries to update the first name from <code>John</code> to anything else, the value gets saved as <code>Smith</code>
              instead.</p>
            <pre><code>trigger FirstName on Contact(after update){

    List&lt;Contact&gt; con = Trigger.old;
    List&lt;ID&gt; conId = new List&lt;ID&gt;();
    List&lt;Contact&gt; finalList = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();

    for (Contact iterator: con){
        if(iterator.FirstName == 'John'){
            conId.add(iterator.Id);
        }
    }

    List&lt;Contact&gt; updateList = [SELECT ID, FirstName FROM Contact WHERE ID = :conId];

    for (Contact iterator: updateList){
        iterator.FirstName = 'Smith';
        finalList.add(iterator);
    }

    update finalList;

}
</code></pre>
            <p>While this seems like a lot of code it’s easy to understand with a breakdown:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>First we make an <code>after update</code> trigger. The reason behind this is <code>Trigger.old</code> doesn’t exist until a change has occurred in the values.</li>
              <li>We make 3 lists. <code>con</code> to hold old values. <code>conId</code> to hold the IDs of values we need to update. <code>finalList</code> to update the values.</li>
              <li>The for loop that runs on <code>con</code> goes over the old values and searches for contacts where the First Name was <code>John</code> and stores just he ID in
                <code>conId</code> list.</li>
              <li>Now we run a SOQL query to get all the records with matching IDs that currently exist in our database.</li>
              <li>The for loop runs over the matches and changes their First Name to <code>Smith Cool</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first question that arises is <em>When to use Before and After Triggers</em>. For this, we need to understand the <em>Order of Execution</em> first.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2></a>Order of Execution</h2>
            <p>Just like the coffee making process which follows a specific sequence, the Order of Execution is a sequence of events that occur when an insert, update or upsert operation occurs in Salesforce. All events in the Order of Execution need
              to successfully execute before data is committed to the database and if there’s a failure, all changes are rolled back and no further events are executed. Below is the Order of Execution in order of occurrence taken directly from
              Salesforce Documentation available <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers_order_of_execution.htm" target="_blank">here</a></p>

            <ul>
              <li>If the request came from a standard UI edit page, Salesforce runs system validation to check the record for:
                <ul>
                  <li>Compliance with layout-specific rules</li>
                  <li>Required values at the layout level and field-definition level</li>
                  <li>Valid field formats</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>When the request comes from other sources, such as an Apex application or a SOAP API call, Salesforce validates only the foreign keys. Before executing a trigger,
                Salesforce verifies that any custom foreign keys do not refer to the object itself.</li>
              <li>Salesforce runs user-defined validation rules if multiline items were created, such as quote line items and opportunity line items.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>
            <p>So now with the knowledge of Order of Execution the answer to <em>How to decide a Before or After Trigger</em> is simple, always use a <code>before</code> trigger unless
              there is a need to use components like ID that require an <code>after</code> trigger and this is coming purely from my experience and other developers.</p>
            <p>Now that we know how to write a trigger, we need to optimize and follow the 2 key rules:</p>
            <h3>1 Trigger. 1 Object.</h3>
            <p>Just how 2 people should not drink from the same cup of coffee at the same time, each object should not have more than 1 trigger. Having more than one trigger will eventually cause problems as the code gets complex, especially in a
              team environment. This is also to
              reduce conflicting code and staying within Governor Limits (More on this tomorrow).</p>
            <h3>Trigger Helper Class</h3>
            <p>Writing all of the code in the trigger itself results in bigger, complex looking files that may later cause issues. To avoid this we call a class and pass values to it
              instead, and call it a Helper Class. Think of it this way, you can directly drink your coffee from the french press or even the pot but a cup reduces the mess of drinking the coffee.</p>

            <p>Let’s rewrite our FirstNamer trigger to use a helper class.</p>
            <h4>FirstNamer Trigger File</h4>
            <pre><code>trigger FirstName on Contact(after update){
    FirstNameHelper.replaceName(trigger.old);
}
</code></pre>
            <h4>FirstNamer Class File</h4>
            <pre><code>public class FirstNameHelper{

    public static void replaceName(List&lt;Contact&gt; con){
        List&lt;ID&gt; conId = new List&lt;ID&gt;();
        List&lt;Contact&gt; finalList = new List&lt;Contact&gt;();

        for (Contact iterator: con){
            if(iterator.FirstName == 'John'){
                conId.add(iterator.Id);
            }
        }

        List&lt;Contact&gt; updateList = [SELECT ID, FirstName FROM Contact WHERE ID = :conId];

        for (Contact iterator: updateList){
            iterator.FirstName = 'Smith';
            finalList.add(iterator);
        }

        update finalList;
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>While most of our code remains the same, we made one big change. In our trigger class, we pass the <code>trigger.old</code> as an input parameter to our helper class, that
              has a method called <code>replaceName</code> that takes a list of contacts as an input. We know <code>trigger.old</code> will be a list of contacts because we are running it within the context of the <code>Contact</code>
              object,<code>trigger FirstName on Contact</code>. But what if we want to execute different helper classes at different times?</p>
            <p>Let’s say in our example, we have a trigger called <code>NameReplacer</code> that runs on the <code>Contact</code> Object and runs at two different times. When it’s
              <code>before insert</code>, we want to run a method <code>firstName()</code> that replaces first name, and during the <code>after update</code> we want to run a method <code>lastName()</code> that replaces last name. We use Trigger
              Context Variables to achieve this.</p>
            <h2>Trigger Context Variables</h2>
            <p>All triggers allow the developer to access run time context, which roughly means we get to define what processes run at what time. This is available in methods of Trigger
              class, available <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers_context_variables.htm" target="_blank">here in the official documentation</a>:</p>

            </div>
            <p>Let’s write our <code>NameReplacer</code> trigger:</p>
            <pre><code>trigger NameReplacer on Contact(before insert, after update){
    if (Trigger.isBefore &amp;&amp; Trigger.isInsert){
        firstName();
    }
    if (Trigger.isAfter &amp;&amp; Trigger.isUpdate){
        lastName();
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Alternatively, this can be written in nested <code>if</code> statements:</p>
            <pre><code>trigger NameReplacer on Contact(before insert, after update){
    if (Trigger.isBefore){
        if(Trigger.isInsert){
            firstName();
        }
    }

    if (Trigger.isAfter){
        if(Trigger.isUpdate){
            lastName();
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Either ways works and is on the developer to choose which format they prefer. Personally, I prefer nesting inside <code>if</code> statements to keep the file easily
              readable. We will look into remaining Trigger Context Variables like <code>oldMap</code> and <code>newMap</code> in the next chapter.</p>
            <p>The next question that comes instantly is <em>Why to write triggers when Flows/Process Builder/Workflow can be used instead?</em>. A very simple answer for functionalities
              that overlap (like updating a record), is purely on <em>what you prefer</em>. If I am working on an org and I need to update contacts based on a criteria, I will write a trigger and helper class because I am comfortable with it, but my
              colleague who is an Administrator might end up making a Flow that does the same job. Apart from preferance, Triggers actually excel when it comes to testing more complex automations that can be done using flows, and require less
              computing power to execute making them faster. Where triggers, or writing Apex in general lacks behind is the fact that <em>you cannot write your code in production</em>. All Apex code needs to be in a sandbox environment and needs to
              pass 75% code coverage to be moved into production.</p>
            <p>We look more into Apex Test Classes and other techincal requirements later in the course.</p>
